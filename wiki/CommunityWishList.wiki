#summary List of community driven features

== What can the community do to help? ==

We are generated a list of features that we will triage and vote on as a community for future releases. So far Green Energy folks have come up with the following wish list:

  * DNP secure authentication
  * TLS security implementation via [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/ssl.htmlBoost.Asio's support for OpenSSL]
  * Improved code documentation and testing
  * Security testing using targeted exploits and fuzzing
  * File transfer and device profile support
  * Improved test set and config file support
  * Platform independent XML binding support
  * Multi-core support using boost::asio::io_service::strand
  * Acceptance testing platform written using this implementation

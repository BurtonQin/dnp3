== Contributor License Agreement (CLA) ==

Contributors must execute a CLA. This protects copyright interest and prevents incorporation of any patented technology. This process is similar to what the Apache Software Foundation requires of contributors. The CLA can be downloaded [http://dnp3.googlecode.com/files/GEC%20Contribution%20License%20Agreement.doc here].

Disregard the current fax number in the document. You may fax the executed CLA here:

== Workflow ==

The project uses Github for version control. Every contributor works on their own fork of the project:

 * Fork the project, creating a personal copy for yourself.
 * Make your changes and commit them back to your fork
 * Submit a 'pull request' to greenenergycorp or send an email to the google group
 * Someone will review your changes, possibly negotiate modifications, and then merge your changes into the mainline.

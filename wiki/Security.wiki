#summary Security testing conducted on the stack

Green Energy Corp has performed fuzz testing on the stack using the [http://peachfuzzer.com/ Peach Fuzzing Platform]. A few  small issues have been identified using this tool and subsequently resolved. A custom 'pit' file has been defined that describes datalink, transport, and application layer packet structure. The fuzzer will continue to be improved via defined more application layer constructs and coverage analysis.

The Java bindings consist of 2 binary artifacts:

 # A JAR with automatically generated Java bindings
 # A shared library (dll or so) which the JAR references via the static classloader

These two artifacts must be from the same release version of the project. The JAR can be obtained from our maven repository:

        <name>https://repo.totalgrid.org-releases</name>

The Reef project is using the Java binding in production, however, the examples that we current have are written in Scala:

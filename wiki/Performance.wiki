#summary Current performance specification

Many DNP3 stacks/products quote performance numbers in terms of points/sec without specifying how the tests are conducted. These tests could be easily inflated by adjusting the test conditions, types reported, etc. Our integration test configuration is as follows:

  * 100 master/slave pairs talking on the loopback of a single machine
  * Unsolicited messages with no delay/pack timer
  * Even mixture of binary, analog, and counter events

With this configuration, a 2.2Ghz Xeon running Ubuntu can push 600K-700K points per second!

Linux maintains fairly constant performance as the number of connections goes from 1-100 connections.

The number of measurements "pushed" is calculated as follows:

NUMBER_POINTS_CHANGES_CYCLE*NUM_CYCLES*NUM_PAIRS*2

We multiple the point count since a frontend would only have to perform 1/2 of the computation.
